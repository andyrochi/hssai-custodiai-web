# CustodiAI: A System to Predict the Outcome of Child Custody Cases | WebUI

## Introduction to CustodiAI

CustodiAI uses artificial intelligence to predict child custody outcomes in family law cases, providing data-driven insights for legal professionals and individuals involved in custody disputes. Endorsed by the Taiwan Shilin District Court and the Taiwan Judicial Yuan, CustodiAI is actively used by social workers to assist parents in understanding their strengths and weaknesses in custody disputes, thereby increasing opportunities for settlement. The platform was designed and developed by the [Artificial Intelligence for Fundamental Research (AIFR) Group](http://www.phys.nthu.edu.tw/~aicmt/AIFR.html), led by [Prof. Daw-Wei Wang](https://phys.site.nthu.edu.tw/p/406-1335-58679,r3581.php?Lang=en) at National Tsing-Hua University (NTHU).
